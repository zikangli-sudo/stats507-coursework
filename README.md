## Course (brief)
STATS 507 surveys software tools widely used in data science. We start with an accelerated intro to Python, then cover the scientific stack (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn), version control with Git, and working with databases/SQL. The course ends with an introduction to deep learning in PyTorch.
