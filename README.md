# STATS 507 — Data Science and Analytics using Python (Fall 2025)

**Course overview.** STATS 507 surveys core tools used by data scientists in academia and industry. We start with an accelerated introduction to Python, then work through the scientific stack—NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn—along with version control (git) and databases/SQL. The course closes with an introduction to deep learning using PyTorch. Recommended references include *Python for Everybody* (Severance) and *Understanding Deep Learning* (Prince).

**Purpose of this repository.** This repo collects my coursework for STATS 507, including weekly homework, code solutions, notes, and the final project. The goal is to keep my work organized and reproducible, and to document my learning progress throughout the semester.
